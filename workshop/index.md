# Welcome!

Hello everyone and welcome to the "Docker for Neuroscience" workshop conducted at Oldenburg University, we're glad to see you here!

Within these pages, we provide information on how to do the basic setup for the workshop and refresh or gain all the necesary skills you'll need for our workshop. This [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) will include all the necessary info.

If you’d rather download these materials, you can do so via the {download} symbol at the top of the respective page. You can open the respective content (.md files) via an IDE (e.g. VScode, Atom) or via Jupyter Notebooks/Lab.

# I've got a question!

In case you have any questions or difficulties going through the workshop, please don’t hesitate a single second to get in touch with
us. A great way to do this is to via e-mail @ Ernst@psych.uni-frankfurt.de or aaron.reer@uol.de. Or simply ask join the workshop server via this [discord invite link](https://discord.gg/ehN5haXS).
